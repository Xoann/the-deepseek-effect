# The Deepseek Effect

The recent launch of DeepSeek, a powerful yet cost-effective AI model, has profoundly affected the stock market and tech industry. Some analysts believe that DeepSeek's ability to outperform other AI models in a variety of benchmarks while utilizing less sophisticated hardware could be a "Sputnik moment" for China.  This has raised questions about the future of AI dominance especially related to Nvidia, which held a monopoly on the processors that could run most models before Deepseek.
