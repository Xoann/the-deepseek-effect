# The Deepseek Effect

## Overview

The recent launch of DeepSeek, a powerful yet cost-effective AI model, has profoundly affected the stock market and tech industry. Some analysts believe that DeepSeek's ability to outperform other AI models in a variety of benchmarks while utilizing less sophisticated hardware could be a "Sputnik moment" for China. This has raised questions about the future of AI dominance especially related to Nvidia, which held a monopoly on the processors that could run most models before Deepseek.

## Code

We used d3 as our primary data visualization library and bootstrap for styling the page.

Each visualization is built inside its own class using d3 conventions and the init, wrangle, update pipeline.
